Cloud IoT Core Androidthings
============================
[TOC]

The Cloud IoT Core Client makes it simple to integrate Android Things with Cloud IoT Core by providing abstractions for all of Cloud IoT Core's device functions:

+ Publishing telemetry events
+ Publishing device state
+ Receiving device configuration from Cloud IoT Core
+ Receiving device commands from Cloud IoT Core

The library handles all concurrency so clients can use it in the main thread. It also manages interactions with the Cloud IoT Core MQTT bridge so users don't have to worry about low-level networking protocols.
