/**
 * IotCoreClient manages interactions with Google Cloud IoT Core for a single device.
 *
 * <p>This class provides mechanisms for using Cloud IoT Core's main features. Namely
 * <ul>
 *    <li>Publishing device telemetry</li>
 *    <li>Publishing device state</li>
 *    <li>Receiving configuration changes</li>
 *    <li>Receiving commands</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Create a new IotCoreClient using the {@link IotCoreClient.Builder}, and call
 * {@link IotCoreClient#connect()} to initialize the client connection. When you no longer
 * need to send and receive data, call {@link IotCoreClient#disconnect()} to close the connection
 * and free up resources.
 *
 * <p>Track the current connection using {@link IotCoreClient#isConnected()} or register a
 * {@link ConnectionCallback} to listen for changes in the client's conn, and publish data to Cloud
 *
 * <p>Publish data to Cloud IoT Core using {@link IotCoreClient#publishTelemetry(TelemetryEvent)}
 * and {@link IotCoreClient#publishDeviceState(byte[])}. These methods can be used regardless of the
 * client's connection state. If the client is connected, messages are published immediately.
 * Otherwise, if the client is disconnected, messages are stored in memory and sent when the
 * connection is reestablished.
 *
 * <p>Register an {@link OnConfigurationListener} with the client to receive device configuration
 * changes from Cloud IoT Core.
 *
 * <pre class="prettyprint">
 *     IotCoreClient iotCoreClient = new IotCoreClient.Builder()
 *             .setConnectionParams(connectionParams)
 *             .setKeyPair(keyPair);
 *             .setOnConfigurationListener(onConfigurationListener)
 *             .setOnCommandListener(onCommandListener)
 *             .setConnectionCallback(connectionCallback)
 *             .build();
 *     iotCoreClient.connect();
 *     iotCoreClient.publishDeviceState("Hello world!".getBytes());
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>While disconnected, the client queues all messages for delivery when the connection is
 * restored. To customize the behavior of the offline message queue, call
 * {@link IotCoreClient.Builder#setTelemetryQueue(Queue)} with a queue implementation suited to
 * your application. If no queue implementation is provided, the default queue implementation is a
 * queue that stores up to 1000 telemetry events and drops events from the head of the queue when
 * messages are inserted beyond the maximum capacity.
